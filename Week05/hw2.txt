In static init block of A
In static init block of B
In instance init block of A
In constructor A.
In instance init block of B
In constructor B.

This is because the code defines two classes, A and B, where B extends A.
Both classes have instance and static initializer blocks, 
which are executed during object creation and class initialization respectively.
