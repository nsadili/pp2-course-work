Output:

In constructor X.
In constructor Y.

We have two classes here, X and Y, with Y being a subclass of X. 
The new keyword is used in the Main class to create an instance of Y. 
This calls the constructor of Y, which calls the constructor of its superclass X.

Output:

In static init block of A

In instance init block of A
In constructor A.
In instance init block of B
In constructor B.

We have two classes here, A and B, with B being a subclass of A. 
Static and instance initialization blocks are used in both classes to initialize static and instance variables, respectively.

We have two classes here: Parent and Child, with Child being a subclass of Parent. 
The function calcValue in the Parent class takes a single integer parameter a and returns an integer. 
The Child class replaces the Parent class's calcValue function with one that accepts two integer inputs, a and b, and returns an integer.

Method overriding happens when a subclass offers a customized implementation of a method that its parent class already supports.
In this situation, ClassB is overriding ClassA's non-static method methodTwo(int I The method signature (method name and argument list) must match the overridden method in the parent class.
