1. Single:In single inheritance, a subclass receives traits and behaviors from just one superclass. 
	  The subclass inherits all the qualities of the superclass.

Ex: A class "Student" can inherit from a parent class "Person", which contains common properties and methods for all types of people.

2. Multilevel:In multilevel inheritance, a subclass acquires properties and methods from its parent class, which in turn receives traits and behaviors from another parent class. 
              The subclass has access to all the qualities of both parent classes.

Ex: A class "GoldenRetriever" can inherit from "Dog" which inherits from "Animal". 

3. Hierarchical: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class. 
                 Each subclass has its own distinct qualities in addition to the traits inherited from the parent class.

Ex: A class "Cat" and a class "Bird" can both inherit from "Animal". 

4. Multiple: In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits traits and behaviors from two or more parent classes. 
             The subclass has access to all the qualities of each parent class.

Ex: A class "RobotDog" can inherit from both "Dog" and "Robot" classes. 

5. Hybrid: Hybrid inheritance is a mixture of two or more inheritance types, which can include single, multilevel, hierarchical, and/or multiple inheritance within a single program.

Ex: A class "Smartwatch" can inherit from "Watch" (single inheritance) and "ElectronicDevice" (multiple inheritance) at the same time.
