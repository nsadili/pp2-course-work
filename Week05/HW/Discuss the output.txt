The output of this code: 

In constructor X.
In constructor Y.

Explanation: 

Because the code specifies two classes, X and Y, where Y extends X, this output is the result. When an instance of the X class is made, the constructor for that class prints the phrase "In constructor X.". 
The constructor of the Y class prints the phrase "In constructor Y." whenever an instance of the Y class is generated.

The new keyword is used in the main method to generate a fresh instance of Y. The constructors of both X and Y are then summoned sequentially as a result of this. 
When Y is instantiated, its constructor is immediately called before the constructor of its parent class X. 
Consequently, "In constructor X." and "In constructor Y." are written in that order.
