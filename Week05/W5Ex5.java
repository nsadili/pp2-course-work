/*In Java, there are different types of inheritance. 
The simplest is single inheritance, which occurs when one class 
is extended by only one other class. Multilevel inheritance is similar, 
but with multiple levels of classes being extended. For example, Class A
 extends Class B, and Class C extends Class A, making it a multilevel inheritance.

Hierarchical inheritance is another type in which one class is extended by
 two or more classes. On the other hand, multiple inheritance is not directly supported
  in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces. This type of inheritance allows a 
  class to inherit from multiple interfaces, which defines the behaviors it can
   exhibit. It is the opposite of hierarchical inheritance, where one class is
    extended by multiple classes.

Finally, hybrid inheritance is a combination of hierarchical and multiple inheritance
, which can be the most complex type of inheritance to implement in Java. */
