// Single - is the easiest type to extend one class from another. We call this inheritance as a single, when we have only one class to extend 
// Multilevel - multilevel inheritance is the same as a single, but there are more classes to be extended. For example, let we have class A, which
//inherit from class B. Moreover, we have C which inherit from class A, which entitle as to call this type of inheritance as a multilevel one
//Hierarchical - this type of inheritance relates to codes, which have two or more classes, which are extended by one class. 
//Multiple - multiple type of inheritance is an "impossible" one. We can not apply it by writing a code, however can access to it with the usage of interface.
//Also we can say that multiple type is antonymous to the hierarchical one, because there we refer one class to two, not vice a verse.
//Hybrid - a hybrid of hierarchical and multiple types of inheritance. It can be considered as the most complicated one
