Standard methods have the advantage of being able to be called directly on the class itself without the need to first create an instance of that class's object. This can be helpful if you have methods that don't rely on any class instance variables and simply run calculations on some input values. Since all of the methods in MathDemo are conducting mathematical computations and don't require any instance variables, it might make sense in this situation to define them as static methods. The particular use case and whether the method requires access to any instance variables of the class will determine whether a method should be defined as static or not.
