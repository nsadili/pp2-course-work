5. [HW] Discuss the types of inheritance. Give examples.
• Single
• Multilevel
• Hierarchical
• Multiple
• Hybrid

1)Single 
Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class inherits properties and behavior from a single parent class. 
The parent class is known as the superclass or base class, and the child class is known as the subclass.

2)Multilevel
Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class inherits from a parent class, 
which is already inherited from another parent class. 
In a word, a subclass is created from another subclass.

3)Hierarchical
Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in which multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

4)Multiple
Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class inherits properties and behavior from multiple parent classes.

5)Hybrid
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance.
In other words, it involves inheritance from both classes and interfaces.
