The output of the given code is:

Super
10
Subclass
30

This is because the code defines two classes, Parent and Child, where Child extends Parent. 
The Parent class has a method called calcValue which takes an integer parameter,
and the Child class overrides this method with a different implementation that takes two integer parameters.
