The output of the code when run will be:

In static init block of A
In static init block of B
In instance init block of A
In constructor A.
In instance init block of B
In constructor B.


This is because class A has both a static initialization block and an instance initialization block, which are executed when the class is loaded and each time an instance of the class is created, respectively. Class B extends A, so its constructor will implicitly call the constructor of its superclass (A() method) before executing its own code.
