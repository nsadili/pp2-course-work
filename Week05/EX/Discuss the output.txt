The output this code:

In static init block of A
In static init block of B
In instance init block of A
In constructor A.
In instance init block of B
In constructor B.

Explanation:

The code consists of two classes, X and Y, where Y is a subclass of X. Both classes have constructors that print a message when an instance of the class is created. 
When the main method is executed, a new instance of Y is created, which triggers the constructors of both X and Y to be called in sequence. 
As a result, the output of the program shows the messages printed by the constructors of both classes in the order they are executed.
