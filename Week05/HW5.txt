Inheritance is a way to create new classes based on existing classes. There are different types of inheritance:

Single inheritance: a subclass inherits from a single superclass.
Example: class Car extends Vehicle

Multilevel inheritance: a subclass inherits from a superclass, which itself inherits from another superclass.
Example: class SportsCar extends Car

Hierarchical inheritance: multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
Example: class SUV extends Vehicle, class Truck extends Vehicle

Multiple inheritance: a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses.
Example: class HybridCar extends ElectricCar, GasolineCar

Hybrid inheritance: a combination of different types of inheritance.
Example: class ElectricSUV extends SUV, ElectricCar
