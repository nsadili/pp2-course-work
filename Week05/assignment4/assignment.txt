The output will be:

AS
GTS
5 AC
A
GT
GTC

This is so because A and GeneralType are two classes in the software. A is a subtype of GeneralType.

A static block and an instance block are the two code sections found in class A. Before any instances are made, the static block is once only executed when the class is loaded. Every time a new instance of the class is generated, the instance block is executed.

The integer number is printed along with the string "AC" by class A's constructor, which also accepts an integer argument. Without any parameters, the no-argument constructor prints "AC".

Additionally, there are two code blocks in the class GeneralType: a basic block and an instance block. Before any instances are made, the static block is once only executed when the class is loaded. Every time a new instance of the class is generated, the instance block is executed.

Using the super(5) statement, the constructor of GeneralType invokes the constructor of its superclass A with an integer argument of 5. "GTC" is then printed.

The main method is absent when the program starts, so it simply executes the static blocks and constructors of the classes.

The static block of class A, which prints "AS," is executed first. The static GeneralType block, which prints "GTS," is then run.

The constructor of A is called with an integer argument of 5, which prints "5 AC," when the constructor of GeneralType is called with super(5). Then, the instance block of A is executed, which prints "A".

After printing "GT" and the string "GTC" from the GeneralType constructor, the instance block of GeneralType is finally executed.
