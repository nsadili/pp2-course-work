In the given code, ClassB is a subclass of ClassA, and it has methods that either override or hide the corresponding methods in its superclass. Specifically, methodTwo and methodThree are overriding methods of ClassA, while methodOne and methodFour are hiding methods of ClassA. Method overriding happens when a subclass provides its own implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. Method hiding, on the other hand, occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation for a static method that is already defined in its superclass.
