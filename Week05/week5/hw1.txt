In constructor X.
In constructor Y.

This is because when an object of class Y is created, its constructor is called first, which in turn calls the constructor of its superclass X using the "super()" keyword. The constructor of X is responsible for printing "In constructor X.". Once the constructor of X is executed, the constructor of Y is then executed, printing "In constructor Y." to the console.
