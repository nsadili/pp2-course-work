Super
10
Subclass
30

When the program is executed, it creates an object of class Child and calls the calcValue method twice with different sets of arguments. Here's what happens for each call:

1. child.calcValue(5) calls the calcValue(int a) method in the superclass Parent. This method prints "Super" to the console and returns the value a * 2 which is 10.
1. child.calcValue(5, 10) calls the calcValue(int a, int b) method in the subclass Child. This method prints "Subclass" to the console and returns the value (a + b) * 2 which is 30.

The reason for this behavior is that the Child class overrides the calcValue(int a) method of its parent class Parent with a method of the same name but with different parameters calcValue(int a, int b). This means that when the calcValue method is called with two arguments, the overridden method in the subclass is called
