In static init block of A
In static init block of B
In instance init block of A
In constructor A.
In instance init block of B
In constructor B.

This is because when the program is executed and an object of class B is created, the following events occur in the following order:

1. The static initialization block of class A is executed, which prints "In static init block of A".
2. The static initialization block of class B is executed, which prints "In static init block of B".
3. The instance initialization block of class A is executed, which prints "In instance init block of A".
4. The constructor of class A is executed, which prints "In constructor A.".
5. The instance initialization block of class B is executed, which prints "In instance init block of B".
6. The constructor of class B is executed, which prints "In constructor B.".
