In the code, ClassB extends ClassA, which means ClassB inherits all the non-private methods of ClassA. 
ClassB then provides its own implementation for some of these methods, which can result in overriding or hiding.

Overriding: When a subclass provides a method with the same name and signature as the method in its superclass,
it is said to be overriding the superclass method. This is the case with methodTwo in ClassB, which overrides the method of the same name in ClassA.

Hiding: When a subclass provides a method with the same name as a method in its superclass, 
but with a different signature (i.e., different parameters or return type), it is said to be hiding the superclass method. 
This is the case with methodOne and methodThree in ClassB, which hide the static method methodOne and the static method methodThree in ClassA.

Not overriding or hiding: Finally, methodFour is defined in both ClassA and ClassB with the same signature, so it neither overrides nor hides the superclass method.
