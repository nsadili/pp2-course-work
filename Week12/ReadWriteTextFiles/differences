Differences between read() and read(char[]):

read():
This method reads a single character from the file and returns its Unicode code as an integer.
It returns -1 when the end of the file is reached.
In this approach, you read the file one character at a time, which can be slow for large files.


read(char[]):
This method reads a sequence of characters from the file into an array (usually of fixed size) and returns the number of characters read.
It also returns -1 when the end of the file is reached.
This approach is more efficient for reading large files because it reads multiple characters at once, reducing the number of I/O operations required.
