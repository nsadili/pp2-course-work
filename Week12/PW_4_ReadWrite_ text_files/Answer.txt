The read() method and the read(char[]) method are both used to read the contents of a file in Java, but they differ in how they read the file:

read() method:
Reads a single character at a time from the file.
Returns the ASCII value of the character as an integer.
Returns -1 when it reaches the end of the file.
Makes a system call for each character read.
Slower when reading large files.


read(char[]) method:
Reads a specified number of characters from the file into a character array.
Returns the number of characters read.
Returns -1 when it reaches the end of the file.
Reads a block of characters at a time, reducing the number of system calls needed.
Faster when reading large files.
