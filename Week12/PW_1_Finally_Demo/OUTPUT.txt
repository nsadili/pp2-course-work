//When executed, the program produces the following output:
Exception in thread "main" ExceptionDemo3
    at FinallyDemo.testFinally(FinallyDemo.java:15)
    at FinallyDemo.main(FinallyDemo.java:6)

/*
As expected, the program throws an instance of ExceptionDemo3 from the finally block, and the stack 
trace shows that this exception was thrown on line 15 of the testFinally method.
