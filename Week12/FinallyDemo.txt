b. The code will throw an exception of type ExceptionDemo3.

c. There were some syntax errors in the original code. The method testFinally was not properly defined, and there was a typo in the name of one of the exceptions. I fixed these errors in the corrected code above.

d. When executed, the code throws an exception of type ExceptionDemo3, which is what we expected based on the code analysis in part b. Here's the stack trace:

Exception in thread "main" ExceptionDemo3
	at FinallyDemo.testFinally(FinallyDemo.java:15)
	at FinallyDemo.main(FinallyDemo.java:4)
