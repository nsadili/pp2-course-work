In this case, the EOF (end-of-file) indicator is the EOFException.
When the ObjectInputStream reaches the end of the file, it will throw an EOFException.
To ensure that all persons are read from the file, the program continues reading objects from the file in a loop until an EOFException is caught.
Once the EOFException is caught, the loop breaks, and the program finishes reading from the file.
