The wind it howls, the leaves they rustle,
As autumn makes its grand entrance subtle.
The trees they shed their emerald hues,
Replacing them with golds and reds and blues.

The sun sets earlier, the nights grow longer,
But don't be sad, don't be a mourner.
For with the darkness comes a shining light,
As stars twinkle and dance throughout the night.

So embrace the change, the ebb and flow,
Let nature's rhythm guide you as you go.
And know that though the seasons may change,
The beauty of life remains, ever so strange.
