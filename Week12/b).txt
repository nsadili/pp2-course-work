In the given code, the testFinally() method is being called in the main method. The testFinally() method contains a try-catch-finally block. Here's what happens step by step:

Inside the try block, an ExceptionDemo4 exception is thrown.
The catch block catches the ExceptionDemo4 exception.
Inside the catch block, a new ExceptionDemo2 exception is thrown.
The finally block executes after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. In this case, a new ExceptionDemo3 exception is thrown in the finally block.
The ExceptionDemo3 exception thrown in the finally block will suppress the ExceptionDemo2 exception thrown in the catch block. The main method catches the ExceptionDemo3 exception and calls e.printStackTrace().
