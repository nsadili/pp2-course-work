a. The clone() function for the Point and Segment classes is shallowly implemented by me. With the same field values as the original object, the super.clone() method produces a new object. Because the variables in the Point class are primitive, it is only a shallow clone. Segment class copies the reference to the Point objects, so the new object refers to the same Point objects as the original object in this instance.

b. We can change the clone() method to create new instances of the mutable objects and copy their fields to the cloned object in order to implement a deep clone. The clone() function for the Point object in the code produces a new Point object with the same coordinates as the original object. For the start and finish points, new Point objects are created using the clone() method for Segment.

c. In-memory serialization is another way of cloning objects in Java. The object is first serialized to a stream, and then it is deserialized to produce a new object with the same state. Although it may not be as effective as using the clone() method, it does take more code. Additionally, if the item being copied cannot be serialized, it might not succeed. In-memory serialization should therefore only be used when required.
